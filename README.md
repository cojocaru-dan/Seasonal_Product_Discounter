# Seasonal Product Discounter v1 Project
## In this project, we create a clothing shop application. We must keep track of products, discounts and we must calculate the eventual price for the products. We develop a program that check various types of discounts and apply the relevant ones for a specific product on a specific day.

## Currently, there are three types of discounts.
### •	Monthly discounts:
#### o	Summer Kick-off, 10% discount on every product during June and July.
#### o	Winter Sale, 10% discount on every product during February.
### •	Color discounts:
#### o	Blue Winter, 5% discount on every blue-colored product during winter.
#### o	Green Spring, 5% discount on every green-colored product during spring.
#### o	Yellow Summer, 5% discount on every yellow-colored product during summer.
#### o	Brown Autumn, 5% discount on every brown-colored product during autumn.
### •	Seasonal discounts:
#### o	Sale Discount, 10% discount if the item is bought right before or right after the favored season. (Such as buying winter gloves during spring.)
#### o	Outlet Discount, 20% discount if the item is bought two seasons after the favored season. (Such as buying winter gloves during summer.)

## The Seasonal Product Discounter will be an ongoing project. With each new sprint, we are going to to add new features to the project, and improve existing ones.

## our application should:
### •	satisfy the Single Responsibility Principle
### •	use the Interface Segregation Principle
### •	use Dependency Injection
### •	include logging of the operations
### •	follow Clean Code Principles

## we covered concepts like: collections, extension methods, static classes, records, Enum conversions.
